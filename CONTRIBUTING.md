# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project, you are awesome ðŸŽ‰
To keep the work here simple, collaborative and relaxed, please read the following file as well as the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adrianbaumgart/spotify-web-light/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## How to contribute

First, you need to know how you wanna contribute.

### Contribute directly to the code

For that, you'll need to know CSS and a bit about website structure. If you want to contribute to the code, please perform the following steps:

- Fork the project
- Add your code (to both CSS files!)
  - do not change the metadata over the actual CSS code
- Create a pull request
- Wait ðŸŽ‰

### I don't know CSS but want to contribute

That's awesome, it's possible to contribute without knowing CSS. You can just create an issue containing a bug report or a feature request. Make sure to choose one of the provided templates and fill out all fields as possible.

For any kind of issue, screenshots are important, because this is a "visual tweak". Please add them to the issue if possible.
